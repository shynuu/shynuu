### Hi Folks ðŸ‘‹

---

I am a network researcher and passionate about new technologies, the convergence of software, and virtualization with networking is the best today.

I love to think about the future of the internet, design new protocols, always keep up to date, and develop new networking technologies.

Currently working on 6G and Satellite Networks, both networks are amazing but more powerfully integrated! QKD is also nice but they still require more work...

In my free time, I like to contribute to projects that benefit the community and of course, take a hike :smile:
